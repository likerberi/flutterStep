Purpose: HDF5 conversion transforms fragmented raw data into a single, hierarchical binary file to maximize I/O efficiency.  

Benefit: It resolves system bottlenecks by bundling millions of small files (like images or logs) into one organized container.  

Structure: The format supports complex data structures and metadata, acting like a self-contained file system within a file.  

Optimization: It enables advanced storage techniques like chunking and compression to balance access speed and file size.  

Tools: Python libraries such as h5py and pandas are the standard tools for converting data between system memory and HDF5 format.  

import h5py  
import numpy as np  
  
# 0. Dummy Data Generation  
data_to_save = np.random.random((100, 100))  
    
# 1. Write: Convert NumPy array to HDF5  
with h5py.File('data.h5', 'w') as f:  
    f.create_dataset('dataset_1', data=data_to_save)  
    print("Saved to data.h5")  
  
# 2. Read: Load data from HDF5  
with h5py.File('data.h5', 'r') as f:  
    loaded_data = f['dataset_1'][:]  
    print(f"Loaded shape: {loaded_data.shape}")
