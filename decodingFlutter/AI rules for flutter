In Flutter,   
## Flutter style guide  
* **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase.  
* **Concise and Declarative:** Write concise, modern, technical Dart code.  
  Prefer functional and declarative patterns.  
* **Composition over Inheritance:** Favor composition for building complex  
  widgets and logic.   
* **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures. Widgets (especially  
  `StatelessWidget`) should be immutable.  
* **State Management:** Separate ephemeral state and app state. Use a state  
  management solution for app state to handle the separation of concerns.  
* **Widgets are for UI:** Everything in Flutter's UI is a widget. Compose  
  complex UIs from smaller, reusable widgets.  
* **Navigation:** Use a modern routing package like `auto_route` or `go_router`.  
  See the [navigation guide](./navigation.md) for a detailed example using  
  `go_router`.
