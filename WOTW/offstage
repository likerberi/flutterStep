Offstage(  
  offstage: true/false // visibility  
  child:~  
)  

When offstage property is set to true, the child is hidden (not painted and takes no layout space).  
  
The child still remains active: it can receive focus and continue animations.  
  
It is useful for cases where you want to keep the widget alive, maintain its state, or measure it, but hide it from the UI.
